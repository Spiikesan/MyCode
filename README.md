# MyCode
This repository will contain a Lexer/Parser/Compiler/Virtual Machine that will be very modular, written in C (Linux, maybe Windows later).

With MyCode, you can create your own language, or just add anything you want to an existing.

This project will use my C-modular library available here: https://github.com/Spiikesan/C-modulaire
